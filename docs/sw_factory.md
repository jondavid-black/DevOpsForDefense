## Software Factory

Starting in July 2019, we'll present a series of topics on the Software Factory.  We're hearing about 
the Software Factory concept from our government customers (and seeing it in RFPs).  But what is a Software Factory?  How can we create a 
Software Factory withing the constraints and demads of our industry?  As we go through this series we will work to answer
these questions and provide some hands-on perspective by building and demonstrating our own small scale Software Factory.  
We will stick to our committment to transparency by using only open source solutions and publishing everything we create
to our github repository under an open source license.  Please join us for the journey and let us know what topics we 
can include that will help you succeed.

								<p>DevOps for Defense is a public forum where technical professionals can learn, share, and create relationships as many of us make the challenging
										transition from legacy waterfall development to Agile/DevOps continuous delivery practices.  We are based in Huntsville, AL where Redstone Arsenal plays
										a major role in the local community. Many of us work for or with government agencies and services to produce systems that defend our
										nation, our men and women in uniform, and our allies.  These systems are often complex, global in scale, highly regulated, and developed 
										within monumental bureacrocies and command-and-control management cultures.  The DevOps for 
										Defense meetup strives to provide the resources, knowledge, and support for the local technical professional community to drive
										successful transition in their projects, programs, and careers.  DevOps for Defense is committed to transparency and 
										posts all our material to GitHub under open source licenses.</p>
								<p>We started the meetup in December of 2017 with 8 participants.  Since then we've grown to about 30 regular participants with our peak attendance
									around 70 when <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> provided a talk on the 
									<a href="https://github.com/jondavid-black/DevOpsForDefense/blob/master/Meetup/2018/2018-12%20DO4D%20-%20Stack%20Overflow.pdf">Power of Knowledge</a>.  
									We've had great support from the local community.  Everything we do is on a pure voluntary basis.  
									We've been fortunate to have a number of excellent volunteer guest speakers along the way.  If you would like to present 
									at our monthly meetup please contact the meetup organizers via e-mail or through social media.  Starting in 2019, 
									TEKsystems is sponsoring our meetup and provides books for our book club, swag, and public outreach / awareness in the community.
								</p>
								<p>
									We have a pretty standard agenda every month.  We meet on the first Thursday of the month and start about 6 pm...depending on traffic.

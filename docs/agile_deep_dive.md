## Agile Deep Dive

Many of our programs are going through the transition from Waterfall to Agile.  This is a major change in how we 
work and even how we think.  Agile challenges the long standing bureaucrocies we've build into our programs.  Agile 
challenges the command-and-control / approval cultures we've been conditioned to accept as normal.

The DevOps for Defense is doing a series of presentations on Agile program execution to help our community understand 
the details of Agile, how to do Agile right, and how to tailor Agile to our industry.

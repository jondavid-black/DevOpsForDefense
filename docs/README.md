# DevOps for Defense Web Site
This is the web site for the [DevOps for Defense meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-for-Defense/).  

# Open Source Site Built from Open Source
This site is built using a number of open source technologies.  Primarily, we are using Jekyll (and GitHub Pages) with the Massively theme from HTML 5 and the 
Jekyll translation of that template from [here](https://github.com/jekyllup/jekyll-theme-massively).

## Fast Track and Continuous ATO

This month we welcome guest speakers to our virtual meetup. Dark Wolf Solutions CEO Rick Tossavainen and Deputy Directory Cybersecurity Practice, Tom Marlow are authors of the US Air Force's Continuous ATO Playbook.  As our industry transitions to adope DevSecOps, these practices become foundational to our ability to develop, deliver, and operate our environments. Building upon Risk Management Framework (RMF), Fast Track ATO and Continuous ATO give us the solutions we need to shift left on security and deliver value to our Warfighters at mission speed.  As our government customers explore and evaluate alternitives for cloud-based development (and sometimes operations), our architectures, processes, and tools must evolve. Dark Wolf Solutions will provide an introduction to this changing landscape and give us the knowledge we need to embrace this improvement

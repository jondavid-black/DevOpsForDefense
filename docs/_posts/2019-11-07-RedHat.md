## Automate Everything - Deploy with Confidence
This month we had Joe Gavin and Chris Reynolds from Red Hat, speak to us about the power of automation and containerized cloud native solutions built upon Ansible and OpenShift.  Ansible is an industry leading Infrastructure-as-Code solution that serves as a foundation for ubiquitous configuration management and automated deployment in a DevSecOps world.  OpenShift goes further to provide a scalable, mission critical Platform-as-a-Service layer built upon Kubernetes for rapid, reliable applicaiton deployment and operations management.  The technologies featured by Red Hat in this session are directly applicable to our defense industry work as we transition to embrace the latest DevSecOps guidance provided by the DoD CIO.

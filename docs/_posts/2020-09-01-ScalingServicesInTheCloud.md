## Strategies to Serve Millions with Confidence

This month our local member Vadim Uchitel returns as a guest speaker to our virtual meetup. Vadim shares what he's learned over many years scaling from hundreds to millions of users.  Vadim gives us a view from the commercial world to help us learn the state of the art.  We discuss critical lessons and pitfalls to avoid.  We see the key patterns that have been proven successful as we lean forward to employ cloud native technologies in our systems.

## Integrating Architecture & System Engineering with DevOps
Our industry faces a challenge not seen in the commercial domain...can DevOps and System Engineering work together in harmony?  The systems we build are complex and mission critical, requiring substantial rigor throughout the design, development, and delivery process.  Good system engineering is at the heart of successful program execution, but all too often we see silos form that impede rapid, responsive system delivery.  Traditionally we have employed a years long, document oriented, gate review driven strategy that is often at odds with the DevOps and principles of rapid flow and continuous delivery. Is the System Engineering domain fundamentally in conflict with our DevOps objectives?  We'll examine some of these challenges and present some potential solutions.

This month we also celebrate the DevOps for Defense 3 year anniversary.  I've always tried to do something special for our anniversary meetups.  Our first year welcomed Stack Overflow as our first guest speaker.  our second year we hosted GitHub and John Willis, in addition to Green Pea Press custom silk screen shirts which raised money for Girls Who Code.  In the current COVID-19 pandemic, we don't have a safe way to celebrate like we have in the past.  We'll do our best to celebrate virtually via Zoom (information below), and I've got something planned that I think is pretty special.  I hope you can join us!

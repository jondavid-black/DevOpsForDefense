## DevOps for Defense Welcomes Gradle!
We are extremely pleased to welcome Gradle to Huntsville for our March DevOps for Defense meetup.  Gradle is a powerful, industry leading build automation slution.  Many teams within our industry have been transitioning to Gradle from older solutions over the past few years. Hans Dockter, the Gradle CEO, will join us to review recent advancements in build automation technologies.  These include new capabilities available in Gradle Enterprie to dramatically speed up our build and delivery processes and provide deep insight and analysis for amplified feedback to our product teams.

## Update!
Unfortnuately we had to adjust our original plans.  Hans has to be in Europe the week of our February meetup, so we're going to adjust and welcome him and the Gradle team in March.  Please update your calendars and subscribe to our meetup.com notifications so we can keep you informed of these updates.

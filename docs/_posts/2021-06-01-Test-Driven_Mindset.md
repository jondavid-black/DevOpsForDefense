## Test-Driven Development
As the defense industry transitions from the traditional Waterfall lifecycle to a modern Agile / DevSecOps lifecycle, the mindset around testing can become an obstacle.  This month we'll discuss how we can utilize Test-Driven Development to overcome this obstacle and actually improve the first-time-quality of our systems.  This is not easy.  Many of our systems have been built and fielded using the traditional approach.  I've heard accusations that test and implementation are not sufficiently independent. I've seen test organizations incentivized to ensure failures occur rather than prevent failures from occuring.  I've even seen people decide to quit their job rather than adopt some of these newer test practices.  The objective of this month's meetup is to share some background, some examples, and some new ways to think about "bringing test left in the lifecycle".

Unfortunately we didn't have network connectivity this month and couldn't record the session.  I'll find some time to redo the presentation and post it to the YouTube channel.  If you can't make it to our meetup, remember to subscribe to the DevOps for Defene [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvECCp5P_Oo82ZPN5uRifpA) channel.

## Test-Driven Development
As the defense industry transitions from the traditional Waterfall lifecycle to a modern Agile / DevSecOps lifecycle, the mindset around testing is becoming an obstacle.  This month we'll discuss how we can utilize Test-Driven Development to overcome this obstacle and actually improve the quality of our systems.  This is not easy.  Many of our systems have been built and fielded using the traditional approach.  I've heard accusations that test and implementation are not sufficiently independent. I've even seen people decide to quit their job rather than adopt some of these newer test practices.  The objective of this month's meetup is to share some background, some examples, and ways to think about "bringing test left in the lifecycle".

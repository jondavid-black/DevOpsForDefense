## Software Factory - Documentation

Building a Software Factory begins with understanding our value stream and designing solutions to optimize delivery of a reproducible high quality product.  Often, many of our products are one form of documentation or aother. This month, we explore the hypothesis that we can tailor the principles of the Software Factory to the production of high quality documentation along with our software products.  We explore and demonstrate a prototype approach using free and open source softarre (FOSS) tools. This demonstration builds upon on previous "Magic 8 Ball" pipeline demonstration and adds the generation and delivery of a design document.  The demo content is available on our [Doc_Pipeline](https://github.com/jondavid-black/Doc_Pipeline) GitHub repository.

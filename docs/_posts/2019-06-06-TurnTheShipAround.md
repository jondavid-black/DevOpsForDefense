## Turn The Ship Around - Ties to DevOps
This month we take a look at DevOps leadership and culture.  Megan Ford is our guest speaker.  Megan provides us an overview of a populare book within 
the DevOps community and the leadership perspectives we can learn from a retired Navy submarine captain to apply to our work.  
Megan has spent the last year working as an Agile team Product Owner and was wanted to discover improved leadership 
principles and practices to apply in her work.  I recommended she read <i>Turn the Ship Around</i> by Capt (Ret) 
David Marquet and present what she learned to our community.

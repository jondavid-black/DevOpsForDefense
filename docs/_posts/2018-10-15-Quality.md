## Quality

Delivering software frequently is of no value if that software does not meet the necessary quality standards.  How can we incorporate
quality into our work to drive up our confidence in our delivered systems?  In our industry, quality has been taken over  
to focus more on audit and compliance.  We will advance our CI/CD pipeline to integrate quality and compliance, including

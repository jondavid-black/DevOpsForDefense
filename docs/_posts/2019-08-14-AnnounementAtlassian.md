## Streamline your Agile Team
Atlassian is a leading provider of tools such as Jira, Bitbucket, Bamboo, Confluence, Jira Service Desk, and now Jira Align.  Many teams in our domain use these tools to plan and track their execution, collaborate with their peers, and deliver their systems.  Come out and meet the experts on how to use and integrate the Atlassian suite to help your team or program drive success.  There should be some swag and food as well!

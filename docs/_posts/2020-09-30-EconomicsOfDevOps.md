## Why is DevOps such a big deal?

We'll take a macro level look into the critical basis for the DevOps movement.  As with anything transformative, it is driven by results...economic results!   Within the defense domain we often hear that "this DevSecOps thing is for the software engineers, it doesn't apply to me".  In reality, DevSecOps is foundational to digital transformation we see occurring across commercial, government, and defense industries.  

I hope everyone can join us on Thursday October 1st at 6:00 central.  Connect with us using the Zoom info below.

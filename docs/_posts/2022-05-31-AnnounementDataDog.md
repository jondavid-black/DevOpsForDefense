## Data Dog Guest Speaker
June 2nd we welcome Data Dog as our guest speaker.  They will get us up to speed on the
critical role of continuous monitoring for security and system availability in a modern
application stack like those described in the DoD CIO DevSecOps Reference Design.  Monitoring
modern systems is extremely complex, but critical to operational success.  The Data Dog
team will give us a demo of how this can be done with modern tooling.

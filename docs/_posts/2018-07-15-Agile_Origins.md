## Agile Origins

In the late 1990's it was becoming clear to some that there had to be a better way to create and deliver software 
systems.  A number of competing approaches emerged and fought for dominance.  In 2001, leaders in this new way 
of thinking about software development and delivery met at Snowbird Ski Resort in Utah and established the 
[Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/).  We review the Agile Manifesto and 
discuss how it can be applied to our industry.

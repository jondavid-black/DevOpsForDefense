## Datadog Guest Speaker
This month we welcomed Datadog as our guest speaker.  They provided us an overview of the
critical role of continuous monitoring for security and system availability in a modern
application stack like those described in the DoD CIO DevSecOps Reference Design.  Monitoring
modern systems is extremely complex, but critical to operational success.  The Data Dog
demo showed how they can monitor full stack cloud-based systems from the infrastructure up through
the Kubernetes and container layer and all the way into your detailed application logs, traces, and
even function level performance.  The Datadog demo also highlighted the critical importance of
providing a solid User Experience to help humans work in complex data rich environments.

Huge thanks for Joe and Chris from coming down to meet with our community.  Unfortunately the
video recording of the session didn't pick up the audio so we won't have a YouTube post
for this one.  That said, you can go check out [Datadog's web site](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
or the [Datadog YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/DatadogHQ) for tons of info 
on what Datadog can provide.  Datadog is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution and is currently
working through the FedRamp process, so hopefully it will be offered in IL rated environments
in the near future.

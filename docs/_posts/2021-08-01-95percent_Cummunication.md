## August 2021 Meetup
This month we'll discuss the importance of communication within your team and some ideas on how to improve the communication.  This was one of the most important lessons I learned during my journey to embrace Agile and DevOps practices.  Good communication is at the heart of a professional high performing team.

For those who have tried to join the Zoom for the past two sessions, please don't give up on us!  We've had network problems and couldn't connect.  Hopefully things will be resolved today.  We're going in early to do setup and should be able to get things up and running this month.

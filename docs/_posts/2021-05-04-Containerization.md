## Back to Live!
It's been just over a year since we paused the meetup and went virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  With local numbers down and many of us now fully vaccinated, I'm excited to get back together in person.  But if you're not vaccinated, not comfortable, or someone who's enjoyed participating from across the country we'll still be doing Zoom for you as well.  It'll be a bit of an experiment, but I'm excited to see how well it works for everyone.  The Zoom info is below.

## The Contractor Shall Containerize All the Things
This month we'll discuss containers and go through a quick demonstration.  It's been almost 2 years since the DoD CIO published the DevSecOps Reference Design and we're seeing contract requirements to containerize all over the place.  Since we haven't touched on this topic in a couple years it seems like a good opportuinty to dive back in.  Hopefully you get some value from this and have all the info you need to prove that containers aren't virtual machines!

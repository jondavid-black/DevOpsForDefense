## July 2021 Meetup
This month we'll discuss some anti-patters and patterns for establishing and improving teams.  Over my career I've seen some pretty amazing teams.  I've also seen things go rather unproductive and even toxic.  Great teams don't happen by accident.  I hope the discussion this month helps you improve your team.

Join us in person at the Rocket Republic tap room or online via Zoom.  To our virtual participants, let me appologize for last month where we experienced a network outage in the tap room.  Eventually I'll find some time to redo that presentation and post it to our YouTube channel.

Finally, I hope everyone has a great 4th of July.  Taking time to refresh, spend time with family, and maintain that healthy work-life balance is a really important part of team health and sustainability.

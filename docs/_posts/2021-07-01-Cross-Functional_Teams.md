## July 2021 Meetup
This month we discuss some anti-patters and patterns for establishing and improving teams.  Over my career I've seen some pretty amazing teams.  I've also seen things go rather unproductive and even toxic.  Great teams don't happen by accident.  I hope the discussion this month helps you improve your team.

The [meetup presentation](https://github.com/jondavid-black/DevOpsForDefense/blob/master/Meetup/2021/2021-07%20DO4D%20-%20Cross-Functional%20Teams.pdf) is posted as open source to our GitHub repository.

If you can't make it to our meetup, remember to subscribe to the DevOps for Defene [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvECCp5P_Oo82ZPN5uRifpA) channel. 

Unfortunately the network was down so we couldn't record the Zoom session this month.  I'll try to find time to redo the presentation and publish to the channel.

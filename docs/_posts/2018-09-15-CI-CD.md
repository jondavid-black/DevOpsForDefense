## Continuous Integration & Delivery

The first principle of the Agile Manifesto states: Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.  Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery practices are a widely adopted solution to achieve this 
top priority.  In this presentation, we look at the foundations, fundamentals, and anatomy of a CI/CD solution followed by
a live demonstration.  <a href="https://github.com/DevOpsForDefense/DevOps8Ball">Content for the demonstration</a> is posted as open source to GitHub.

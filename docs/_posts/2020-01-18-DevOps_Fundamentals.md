## DevOps 3 Ways

<div class="image main"><img src="/images/Waterfall_Agile_DevOps_Battle.png" alt="Software Lifecycle Battle - Image customized by JD Black"></div>
At the request from our community, we take a step back and look at the foundational principles of DevOps.  This month we provide an overview of the 3 Ways of DevOps:  Systems Thinking & Flow, Feedback, and Continuous Learning & Experimentation.  We also briefly review the origins of Agile and DevOps, highlighting that our focus should be using these principles to deliver customer value above all.  Agile & DevOps alone are not our goals.  Rather, Agile & DevOps provide us with the tools and techniques to deliver more value to our customers and their mission critical needs.

## GitHub Shifts Left on Cyber Security!
I'm thrilled to announce that GitHub will be our guest speaker for the December 5th meetup!  GitHub is the world's largest software repository supporting over 40 million developers world wide.  We've learned from Jez Humble and Nichole Forsgren's DORA studies that ubiquitous Configuration Management is the #1 indicator for high performing teams.  GitHub and GitHub Enterprise are the market leading CM solutions and go well beyond version control.  The GitHub lead engineer for the DoD and Intelligence Community will tell us about exciting new features like their artifact repository, dependency analysis and vulnerability scanning, and source code [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/) analysis on commit making it much easier to develop and deliver cyber resilient systems.

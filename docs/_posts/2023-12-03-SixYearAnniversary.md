## Celebrating 6 Years of DevOps for Defense
This month we celebrated our 6 year anniversary of DevOps for Defense.  We were joined by some
amazing guests, Gene Kim and Jason Cox.  Gene is the author of the Phoenix Project, the Unicorn Project, DevOps Handbook, and Accelerate.  Jason is the Director of Platforms and Global SRE at Walt Disney.  We took a look at where the meetup started...and why...and reflected on how things have evolved over the past 6 years in our industry and community.  We even enjoyed a wonderful cake with everyone.

We were also joined by our first ever guest speaker, Lou Manglass, the Director of Information Security at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).  And we had an surprise guest, Mikhail Kozorovitskiy, organizer of [DevOps Days Birmingham](https://devopsdays.org/events/2024-birmingham-al/welcome/).  Mikhail shared a very generous discount code with us for the April 17-28 event that I'll pass along in future meetups if you missed it.  I hope everyone will consider attending this event.  It's a great opportunity to learn and network with other DevOps professionals in the region.

And after the event we enjoyed the Rock and Roll power house that is [DadBod](https://www.facebook.com/DadbodHuntsville/)!

It was a great time, and I'd like to thank everyone from the community who came out and made it such a special evening.

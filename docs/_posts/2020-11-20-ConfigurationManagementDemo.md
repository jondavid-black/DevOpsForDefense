## Configuration Management & DevOps
Anyone who has been participating in our meetup will be familiar with the phrase "Good Configuration Management is the #1 leading indicator of high performing teams."  This assertion is based upon published research in the State of DevOps Report and Accelerate by Nichole Forsgren and Jez Humble, a great book on the data and analysis behind that report.  In this new demonstration format video, we take a look at the practices of good CM and apply them to a small code base to illustrate usage.

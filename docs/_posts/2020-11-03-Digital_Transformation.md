## Digital Transformation
This month we examine and unpack Digital Transformation.  Digital Transformation has become a buzz word over the past couple years, but what does it really mean and how does it apply to practical system development and delivery?  We also provide some perspective on the relationship between DevOps / DevSecOps / Dev*Ops and Digital Transformation.

Thanks to everyone who joined for another virtual meetup as we all try to safely navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.  Your contributions and discussion are always appreciated and add to the value of the meetup.  Please keep yourself, your family, and your team safe and healthy.

## Digital Transformation
This month we'll explore Digital Transformation.  This buzz word has been around for a few years now, but what does it really mean in practical terms?  How do the principles of DevOps apply?  Is it a "software thing" or a "cloud thing"?

I hope you can join us for another virtual meetup this Thursday, November 5th, at 6:00 pm Central time.  The zoom information is below.  As usual, all content will be published as open source on our GitHub site and we will be recording the session and posting to our YouTube channel.

    DevOps for Defense is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.

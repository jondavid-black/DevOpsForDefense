## Agile Bookends - Refinement & Retrospective

In an Agile world we need to ensure we unambiguously define our work and continuously improve.  This discussion
focuses on 2 key ceremonies within Scrum execution:  Refinement and Retrospective.  Before starting a sprint we must ensure the 
team understands the work and can execute as a team (vs a collection of individuals).  When we end a sprint we focus on what went well, what 
didn't go well, and what actions the team will take in the next sprint to drive improvement.

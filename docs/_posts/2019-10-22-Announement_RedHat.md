## RedHat to Discuss Cloud Native Solutions!
I'm excited to announce that Red Hat will be our guest speaker for the November 7th meetup!  Red Hat is the world's leading provider of enterprise open source solutions, using a community-powered approach to deliver high-performing Linux, cloud, container, and Kubernetes technologies.  The Red Hat team will talk about how technologies like OpenShift and Ansible can help members of our community as we transition to cloud native architectures using infrastructure-as-code.

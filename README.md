# DevOpsForDefense
Repository for the Huntsville/Madison DevOps for Defense Meetup.  This is a open community to discuss DevOps in our work.

Join us:  https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-for-Defense

E-mail us:  DevOpsForDefense@gmail.com

This is not a sponsored event.  Everything we do is purely voluntary.
If someone (i.e. your small business) would like to sponsor the meetup or an event, please e-mail us or speak to JD or Justan at the next event.
We'd love to use your support to provide food or a round of beers to help attract attention and grow the local DevOps community.

Be sure to thank Rocket Republic Brewing Company for hosting our monthly event.

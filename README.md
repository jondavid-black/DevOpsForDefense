# DevOpsForDefense
Repository for the Huntsville/Madison DevOps for Defense Meetup.  This is a open community to discuss DevOps in our work.

Join us:  https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-for-Defense

This is not a sponsored event.  Everything we do is purely voluntary.
If someone would like to sponsor the meetup or an event, please speak to JD or Justan.
We'd love to use your support to provide food or a round of beers to help attract attention and grow the local DevOps community.

Be sure to thank Rocket Republic Brewing Company for hosting our monthly event.
